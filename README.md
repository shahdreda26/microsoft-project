Data Extraction by read, head ,tail and sample 
Data Cleaning : handle missing values , remove outliers , handle inconsistency values and ensure the dataset is clean
EDA: Visualizations help me understand the data and relationships between features and each other
Data Preprocessing : Feature selection ,numerical features are scales , handle the imbalanced target class by Class Weight Adjustment model and predictions by accuracy
Evaluation : Train models by RandomForestClassifier , evaluate by Calculate metrics ( precision , AUC-ROC ) and plot an AUC-ROC curve to assess the model's performance
